# Code Audit â€“ 5 June 2024

## Overview
A review of the current frontend and backend implementations shows that core integration points are still missing. The Express app now wires controllers and services, but several required route and middleware modules are absent, and the frontend service layer remains unimplemented. As a result, neither the API server nor the React client can complete a full assessment workflow.

## Backend gaps
- `backend/src/app.js` imports `./routes/health`, `./middleware/errorHandler`, and `./middleware/validateRequest`, but these modules are not present in `backend/src`. Trying to start the server will therefore throw `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` before Express finishes booting.
- `backend/src/routes/api.js` is empty, so no HTTP endpoints are registered even if the missing files above were added.
- `backend/src/middleware/auth.js`, `backend/src/middleware/ratelimit.js`, and `backend/src/services/weatherService.js` are placeholder files with no logic. Any feature depending on authentication, custom rate limiting, or weather data will fail once invoked.

## Frontend gaps
- `frontend/src/services/api.js` does not export the `assessmentService` object that `SolarAssessmentApp.jsx` imports. Triggering the assessment action will throw immediately when the module is evaluated.
- `frontend/src/services/imageAnalysis.js` and `frontend/src/utils/calculations` are also empty, leaving the client without helper logic for imagery handling or local calculations if those hooks are needed later.

## Recommended next steps
1. Implement (or stub with working placeholders) the missing backend modules so that Express can start: health route, error handler, request validator, API router, authentication, rate limiting, and weather service.
2. Flesh out `frontend/src/services/api.js` with functions that call the backend controllers (company verification, address geocoding, full assessment, etc.).
3. Decide whether image analysis and calculation helpers should live on the client; if so, populate `frontend/src/services/imageAnalysis.js` and `frontend/src/utils/calculations` with the necessary logic, otherwise remove their usage.
4. After the service layer is complete, add integration tests (or manual verification steps) to confirm that the full assessment flow runs end-to-end.
